        }
        
        func simpleGET(with completion: @escaping ((_ data : Data?) -> ())) -> CancellationSource {
            // Create cancellable token
            let source = CancellationSource()
            //    GET     /posts
            Rest.prepare(HTTPMethod: .GET, url: Configuration.post.posts.url)
                .call(cancelToken: source.token) { (data, responce, error) in
                    // send completion data
                    //completion(data)
            }
